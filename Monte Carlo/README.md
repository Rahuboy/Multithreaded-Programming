Overview:
The C++ File reads input from a file (named 'inp.txt' and present in the same directory), creates the required number of threads, and 
generates a logfile called 'output.txt' containing the value of π (computed using the [Monte Carlo Technique](https://www.cantorsparadise.com/estimating-%CF%80-using-monte-carlo-simulations-3459a84b5ef9)), the time taken in microseconds, and information about
the random points generated.


Input File Format: \
`N K` \
--end-- (not part of file) \
Note that N and K are both numbers. N gives the number of random numbers to be generated for computing π,
and K gives the number of threads. The input file should just contain 1 line, and the two numbers should be space separated.


Execution: 
1) To compile: `g++ -pthread MonteCarlo.cpp` 
2) To execute: `./a.out` 

Note:- No flag is required while compiling in MacOS


Output: \
The code will generate the file 'output.txt'. It contains:
1) The time taken to compute π in microseconds
2) The computed approximate value of π	
3) The lists of random points generated by the threads, lying inside the unit circle in the Monte Carlo Technique
4) The entire list of random points generated by the threads
5) The number of random points generated by the thread (and hence in the square), and the number of points per thread in the unit circle
